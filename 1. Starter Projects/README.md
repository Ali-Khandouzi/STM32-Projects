  Kha1
  In this project, we learn how to work with GPIO, usig toggling a LED on nucleo board.

  Kha2
  This project is about intrupts. We learn how set and reset the LED2(GPIOA, Pin5) using
  a button(GPIOA, Pin13).

  Kha3
  This project is in debugging intruduce setction. show us how retargeting.
  Also, we learn to transfer data using UART in pooling mode.
